- Flexible Execution of Partial Order Plans With Temporal Constraints (Muise, Beck, and McIlraith)
- 

Pending
- Design of an effective algorithm for fast response to the re-scheduling of railway traffic during disturbances

Paid
- Performance analysis of a multi-agent scheduling and control system under manufacturing disturbances
- Dynamic dispatching algorithm for scheduling machines and automated guided vehicles in a flexible manufacturing system

Definitely Using

- Random Seed to use: 22 9 22 1 10 15 15 14




- Replaced Flexibility with Durability
- Adjusted empirical data to be more meaninful with margins
- Tried using a furthest boundary metric, not much use
