INTRODUCTION/MOTIVATION:
=============================================================================================================

- good real life example

When carrying out a set of tasks, an autonomous agent is likely to face unforeseen disturbances. A 
self-driving car's daily driving schedule cannot always predict delays caused by bad weather or even early 
arrivals due to low traffic. Thus, the ability to prepare schedules that are flexible - schedules that remain 
valid even when faced with disruptions - is a desirable property for an autonomous agent. Furthermore, if a 
schedule completes all the required objectives in time even after the disturbance, the agent can avoid the 
burden of rescheduling altogether.

Previous work has examined the notion of flexibility with respect to scheduling problems. Various metrics of 
flexibility have been constructed using the time intervals that constrain events relative to each other in a 
scheduling problem, including using geometric interpretations of these constraints. While these metrics are 
useful in classifying different solution spaces, they do not provide information about particular schedules 
within a given problem.

In this paper, we model the idea of random disturbances in the form of a "random walk" that allows us to 
empirically evaluate the flexibility of solutions to scheduling problems, basing ourselves on the geometric 
interpretation of STNs discussed in Huang et al. We also examine what happens when the constraints of a 
scheduling problem get tighter over time, which views disturbances from the perspective of the network itself, 
rather than from a schedule inside the network. These methods of empirical testing serve the purposes of 
a) helping us form a notion of an "optimal schedule" for a problem and b) validating some metrics over others 
when trying to calculate the overall flexibility of a network.

BACKGROUND: 
=============================================================================================================

- what STNs are
- existing metrics of flexibility (can be simple versions)
	- naive
	- Hunsberger
	- Wilson
- idea of viewing STNs as geometric polytopes
- new spherical metric 

=============================================================================================================
OPTIMAL SCHEDULES: 
=============================================================================================================

The Huang et. al paper defined flexibility as the "room within a schedule [...] to reschedule wihout violating 
the overall time constraints in the case of unexpected opportunities or disruptions". We use a similar 
definition for flexibility, and examine what flexibility means for individual points inside the solution 
spaces of STNs. It seems intuitive that a point that has the most room available for disturbance with respect 
to each constraint, a point that is the farthest away from all boundaries from the geometric solution space of 
an STN, should be the most optimal schedule. Though that criterion may sound simple, there are actually 
multiple points that satisfy it.
- define disturbances

Chebyshev Center:
Building off of Murty's LP, the same linear program that computes the spherical metric for an STN also 
returns the center of the largest inscribed sphere. We will refer to this point for the rest of this paper 
as the Chebyshev center. Although the Chebyshev center for an n-dimensional polytope can refer to both the 
center of the largest inscribed sphere of a polytope and the center of the smallest circumscribed sphere, we 
will use the inscribed sphere definition. 

This schedule could be considered optimal for the reason that it maximizes the distance from all boundaries. 
In a sense, it optimizes for the worst case scenario since it is as far away from any boundary as possible. 
- possibly insert LP here and explain how maximizes distance from all boundaries (Murty 2009)

Centroid:
While the Chebyshev center optimizes for the worst case scenario, another possible center, the centroid, 
optimizes for the expected case scenario. The centroid is defined as the mean position of all the points in 
an n-dimensional polytope, which in this case is the STN solution space. This point considers what 
disturbances are expected to happen, rather than being overly pessimistic and only considering the worst case 
scenario.

Unfortunately, the true centroid is extremely difficult to compute (#P hard, cite source, etc. For now the 
source is Shyan Akmal 2k18). As a naive approximation of the centroid, we took the average of 100 different 
points.
- 100 vs 200 randomly selected points, not much significant difference in the point

Mystery point:
- Nail down each timepoint but do so in order to maximize the volume/flexibility of the remaining n-1 
dimensional polytope, and keep doing so until there are no more timepoints left to assign. 
- possibly early first?
- optimizing for ______

=============================================================================================================
OPTIMAL DISPATCH:
=============================================================================================================

- incorporate time moving forward
- volume of valid STN shrinks, waves of concentric right angles
- possibly always early first?

=============================================================================================================
EMPIRICAL EVALUATION:
=============================================================================================================

Random Walk:
- pick a vector, move one unit in that direction
- normal distribution sphere idea, (cite source. For now the source is Shyan Akmal 2k18)
- count how many steps until reach boundary, take average
- represents how much that one schedule could be perturbed before no longer being a valid solution

Random Shave:
- pick one random boundary, shrink it by one unit
- keep doing so until original point no longer in the STN
- represents changing constraints
- boss suddenly wants something completed earlier than originally expected
- could possibly also incorporate time moving forward, cutting off earlier solutions

Testing Networks:
- correlation of random walk vs different metrics
- correlation of random shave vs different metrics?
- could show table rather than all the graphs
- possibly add in normalized versions of Hunsberger and Wilson

Test Schedules: 
- Random Walk
	- Chebyshev margin of victory vs spherical
	- Centroid margin of victory vs spherical
	- Chebyshev vs centroid
		- inconclusive
	- Mystery point?
- Random shave

Optimal dispatch:
- ________

FUTURE WORK/DISCUSSION:
=============================================================================================================

- Better approximation of centroid
- Metric to separate out Chebyshev vs centroid
- Random walk itself as a metric for flexibility
