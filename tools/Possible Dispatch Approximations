Possible Dispatch Approximations

- Individual events can happen earlier than expected, but time itself only moves forward, solution space shrinking

- early first, maximize solution space flexibility, but individual schedule flexibility and number of reschedules would be bad

- Every second recompute center

- Only reschedule when schedule is outside of boundary

- perhaps plot number of reschedules vs randomWalk lengths
- Best schedules would have fewest number of reschedules, remain valid for the longest time
- if we factor in random walk, recomputing center is more desirable for individual schedule flexibility 


Possible approximations for STNs?

- SREA: just pick one schedule and stick with it, see how many times it can be valid before falling out of constraints

- DREA: recompute the center every time

- SI: recompute center if randomWalk length for the center is x% greater than current schedule's randomWalk length

- AR: reschedule only when randomWalk length reaches some small value
